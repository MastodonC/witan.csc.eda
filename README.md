## Using Scripts

Projection_report – mostly superficial changes, except for the very end when I did a for loop filtering the graphs by age and sample label, but has been superseded by Joiners_age

Joiners_age – has three bits of code in it – one makes a 170 page document with a graph for each sample label in each age, another which facets them all into one page, and another which produces 17 pages with all sample labels on the same graph for each age range

Pathways – creates a table of pathways for an age group with the mean period duration included (filtered by year)

Projected_v_historic_pathways – much the same as pathways, but with separated by historic v projected, and with the table organised so that the ‘most used’ pathways are the highest on the table

Faceted_graphs_of_age – similar to the middle graph of Joiners_age, a document of faceted graphs on one page but edited so that each can be seen clearer – a couple issues about graph lines finishing too early/deciding what would be a good value to filter by

Barcharts_for_ID_pathways – produces barcharts for individual ids showing the pathways they’re expected to take/how long they’re expected to say in each placement
